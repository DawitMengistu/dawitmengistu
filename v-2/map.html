      <p class="t-2 b-p-0 lato">Top Water </p>
      <p class="t-4 p-text lato">Top Water Company is a leading enterprise in Ethiopia, renowned for its high-quality
        bottled water products. Established with a commitment to purity and health, the company utilizes
        state-of-the-art purification technology to ensure its water meets international standards.</p>


      <p class="t-2 b-p-0 lato">The Problem, Marketing Team Performance</p>
      <p class="t-4 p-text lato">
        Top Water Company faces a significant challenge in monitoring and analyzing the performance of its marketing
        team. Currently, there is no concrete evidence to confirm that the marketing team is effectively performing
        their duties during working hours. This lack of accountability makes it difficult to track whether team members
        are visiting agents and stores to report sales and promote the product, which is a crucial aspect of their role.
        Ensuring that the marketing team is actively engaged in these activities is vital for the company's growth and
        market presence.</p>


      <p class="t-2 b-p-0 lato">The Solution, Top Force Field (TFF) </p>

      <p class="t-4 p-text lato">The solution implemented was to track each marketing team member and analyze their
        recorded movements, including the distance they traveled. By monitoring the kilometers covered and the locations
        visited, Top Water Company can gain detailed insights into the activities of each individual during working
        hours. This approach allows the company to verify that team members are visiting agents and stores as required,
        thereby enhancing accountability and enabling a thorough performance analysis.</p>

      <p class="t-4 p-text lato">The system consists of two main components: a mobile app for user registration and
        location tracking, and an admin site for performance analysis.
      </p>
      <div class="gap"></div>
      <p class="t-3 t-p-0 b-p-2 lato">User Registration and Tracking via Mobile App</p>

      <p class="t-4 b-p-0 p-text lato"> <strong> Registration: </strong> Users register through the mobile app using a
        One-Time Password (OTP)
        provided by an admin.
      </p>
      <p class="t-4 b-p-0 t-p-2 p-text lato"> <strong> OTP Verification: </strong> Admins review new user requests on
        the
        admin site and approve access
        by issuing the OTP.
      </p>
      <p class="t-4 p-text t-p-2 lato"> <strong> Location Tracking: </strong> Once registered, the app continuously
        records the userâ€™s location in
        the background, sending data to the server. The recordings are categorized into three sections: Morning,
        Afternoon, and Overtime Hours.
      </p>


      <p class="t-3 lato">Admin Site for Performance Analysis:</p>
      <p class="t-4 b-p-0 t-p-2 p-text lato"> <strong>User Management: </strong> Admins can log in to the
        site to view and manage user registration requests, issuing OTPs to new users.
      </p>
      <p class="t-4 b-p-0 t-p-2 p-text lato"> <strong> Data Analysis: </strong> Admins can select individual users, load
        their
        location data, and analyze their movements. The site displays where users went during specific times of the day
        and the distance traveled in kilometers.
