      <p class="t-2 b-p-0 lato">STEM Power </p>

      <p class="t-4 p-text lato">For more than a decade, STEMpower founders have been implementing many successful STEM
        programs (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) in Ethiopia and nearby countries. Pre-university students
        learn through our hands-on labs, engaging them towards advanced STEM study and careers. STEM enrichment programs
        bridge genders and ethnicity, fostering peace and development within and among nations..</p>


      <p class="t-4 p-text lato">I had the fortunate opportunity to volunteer as a mentor at the Science and Engineering
        Fair (SEF) held at the Foka STEM Center in 2022 and 2023. My role involved teaching participants how to build
        for the web and guiding them through the process of creating web applications to perform computations and solve
        real-world problems.</p>


      <p class="t-2 b-p-0 lato">The Program, Foka STEM Center </p>

      <p class="t-4 p-text lato">STEM Centers are specialized learning facilities that offer hands-on engineering lab
        experience. Local-area students voluntarily and eagerly enroll in various age-appropriate programs offered by
        the STEM Centers, at no cost to the students. Lab mentors guide the students, to accessing modern scientific
        equipment in a comfortable setting. The Centers also serve as venues for local gatherings and regional Science
        Fairs..</p>

      <p class="t-4 p-text lato">At Foka STEM Center, students have access to supplementary programs such as touch
        typing, Rubik's cube solving, and chess competitions. These activities complement the core curriculum, which
        focuses on addressing real-world problems through STEM education.
      </p>

      <p class="t-4 p-text lato">Initially, students learn the fundamentals of
        programming, followed by engaging in research to identify issues that they then tackle using their newly
        acquired skills.

      <p class="t-4 p-text t-p-0 lato">If their project is web-based, we provide comprehensive resources for learning
        web
        development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. We guide them through their projects from start to
        finish, starting with problem identification and solution design. We help them create a Minimum Viable Product
        (MVP), review their progress, assign exercises, and conduct thorough testing, ensuring they successfully build
        and refine their projects.

      <p class="t-3 lato">PIA Day, March 25th 2023</p>
      <p class="t-4 p-text t-p-0 lato">
        The goal of the event was to inspire our attendees enough to explore Processing, Arduino, and the Internet of
        Things on their own and to understand how each of these technologies, including their combination, can be
        implemented in the real world. I chose to build <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> using Processing with
        the students. I
        selected this project due to its simple rules, interesting outcomes, and visually engaging results. It provided
        a good opportunity to dive into algorithms and rendering techniques on a canvas, while also allowing students to
        interact and experiment with the code, enhancing their understanding of programming concepts.
      </p>

      <p class="t-3 lato">Sessions, Effective use of the Internet</p>
      <p class="t-4 p-text t-p-0 lato">In this session, students focused on advancing their projects, which involved
        writing code and troubleshooting numerous bugs. To address these challenges effectively, they learned how to
        utilize the internet efficiently. This included understanding how to use search engines with appropriate
        keywords and operators such as "filetype:". They also explored valuable forums like Stack Overflow, Quora, and
        Reddit, along with leveraging AI tools to find solutions and enhance their problem-solving skills.
      </p>
      <div class="gap"></div>
      <p class="t-4 p-text t-p-0 lato">It was rewarding to see students learn and evolve, witnessing firsthand how even
        a two-month period could significantly impact their lives. The experience at Foka STEM Center is invaluable, and
        it is an honor to be a part of such a transformative journey.
